## Keyboard centric notes

## Features

### Made for power users

Notorious can be controlled entirely with your keyboard. No need to move your hand to the mouse, just open it up and dump your brain.

### Markdown powered (if you want to)

Many like to use Markdown to write their notes. Hack I even use it on paper nowadays. In Notorious you can write your notes however you want, but if you like Markdown, you can easily enable syntax highlighting.

### Dark mode

I love dark mode. Who doesn't?

### Autosave

No need to worry about saving. When you change note or exit the app whatever you wrote gets automatically saved.

### No sync

No need for cumbersome online sync features. Just choose a folder on your disk and that's it. Of course nothing stops you froms syncing that folder with your service of choice. Complete freedom!
